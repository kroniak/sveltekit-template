 * A utility type that creates a new type based on the provided type `T`,

 * It allows all properties of the given type to be optionally defined,
 * while ensuring that once set, they cannot be modified.
 *
 * Use this type when you need to describe an object whose properties
 * might or might not be present and should remain immutable if defined.

 * @template T The type for which this utility type will create a read-only, partial version.

 * utility ensures that all keys within the given record are optional.
 *
 * @template T - A union type representing the possible keys of the record. It extends
 *               `string | number | symbol`.
 * @template K - The type of the values associated with the keys in the record.
